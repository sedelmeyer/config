Deprecated OS X dotfiles and configuration scripts
==================================================

My decade-old Apple laptop finally died. I suspect it was the motherboard. Regardless, that means I now need to rely more on my Linux machine. My old Apple dotfiles have been moved to this ``deprecated/`` subdirectory. 

These files are largely out-of-date and haven't been maintained since 2017. It is likely that I will simply remove those files in a future version of this repository. If I ever become a Mac-user again, I'll likely modify this repository to make it compatible with both types of operating systems.
