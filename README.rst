My personal dotfiles and configuration scripts
==============================================

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and linux configuration scripts.

My decade-old Apple laptop finally died. I suspect it was the motherboard. Regardless, that means I now need to rely more on my Linux machine. This seems like a good time to learn more about Linux, the command line, and all the wonderful Unix tools that exist in the world. It also seems like a good time to automate the build-process for my preferred Linux setup.

My old Apple dotfiles have been moved to the ``deprecated/`` subdirectory. Those files are largely out-of-date and haven't been maintained since 2017. It is likely that I will simply remove those files in a future version of this repository. If I ever become a Mac-user again, I'll likely modify this repository to make it compatible with both types of operating systems.
